# Exploring Weather Trends:

Project Objective:
In the project of exploring weather trends from 1750 to 2013, local and global temperature data will be analyzed and then the temperature trends of New York will be compared to the overall global temperature trends.

Data Source:
Database include 3 tables: 
- city_list table contains a list of cities and countries. 
- city_data table contains a list of cities and countries as well as the yearly local average temperature.
- global_data table contains the yearly average global temperature.

Tools:
The primary tools used are SQL and Excel. SQL will allow us to explore and extract the data from the database, whereas Excel will be used to import the data from SQL in order to calculate the moving average of temperature and then plot the line chart with local and global temperature trends.  

Outline:
Step 1: Check if the city of physical residence is available in the database.
Step 2: Extract the global and local temperature data from the database.
Step 3: Write a SQL query that allows us to make comparison between both temperature trends.
Step 4: Import data to Excel and use the Avg function to calculate the 10-years MA.
Steps 5: Plot Line chart with local and global temperature trends.
Step 6: Observations
